Immediately, there is little documentation for the code.
All documentation for the methods have been added in by yours truly.

Running the code, this simulates, well, particles.
smaller mass has attraction to other bigger mass.
when the mass collides, the bigger one acquires the smaller one, growing.


Make boolean that runs parallel or sequential.

 * NOTE TO URSELF:
 * 1) Java file that runs everything, sequentially and then parallel.
 * 2) Remembers the array sizes and remembers the speed's
 * 3) Checks if anything is wrong with the array sizes. Writes it in the report if there's something wrong.
 * 4) Crunches the speed data, the averages.
 * 5) Compares the speed of the total elapsed time AND average, between sequential and parallel.
 * 6) Create and write a txt document.
